# Getting started with Android Virtualization Framework

## Step 1: Prepare a device

We support the following devices:

* aosp\_panther (Pixel 7)
* aosp\_cheetah (Pixel 7 Pro)
* aosp\_oriole (Pixel 6)
* aosp\_raven (Pixel 6 Pro)
* aosp\_felix (Pixel Fold)
* aosp\_tangopro (Pixel Tablet)
* aosp\_cf\_x86\_64\_phone (Cuttlefish a.k.a. Cloud Android). Follow [this
  instruction](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/create/cuttlefish-use) to
  use.

### Note on Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
AVF is shipped in Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, but isn't enabled by default. To enable
it, follow the instructions below:

1. If the device is running Android 13 or earlier, upgrade to Android 14.

1. Once upgraded to Android 14, execute the following command to enable pKVM.
   ```shell
   adb reboot bootloader
   fastboot flashing unlock
   fastboot oem pkvm enable
   fastboot reboot
   ```
### Note on Cuttlefish
Cuttlefish does not support protected VMs. Only non-protected VMs are
supported.

## Step 2: Build Android image

This step is optional unless you want to build AVF by yourself or try the
in-development version of AVF.

AVF is implemented as an APEX named `com.android.virt`. However, in order for
you to install it to your device (be it Pixel or Cuttlefish), you first need to
re-build the entire Android from AOSP. This is because the official Android
build you have in your device is release-key signed and therefore you can't
install your custom-built AVF APEX to it - because it is test-key signed.

### Pixel

1. [Download](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading)
   source code from AOSP. Use the `main` branch.

1. [Download](https://developers.google.com/android/blobs-preview) the preview
   vendor blob that matches your device.

1. [Build](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/building) the `aosp_`
   variant of your device. For example, if your device is Pixel 7 (`panther`),
   build `aosp_panther`.

1. [Flash](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/running) the built
   images to the device.


### Cuttlefish

1. [Download](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading)
   source code from AOSP. Use the `main` branch.

1. Build Cuttlefish:
   ```shell
   source build/envsetup.sh
   lunch aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-userdebug
   m
   ```

1. Run Cuttlefish:
   ```shell
   cvd start
   ```

## Step 3: Build AVF

Then you can repeat building and installing AVF to the device as follows:

1. Build the AVF APEX.
   ```sh
   banchan com.android.virt aosp_arm64
   UNBUNDLED_BUILD_SDKS_FROM_SOURCE=true m apps_only dist
   ```
   Replace `aosp_arm64` with `aosp_x86_64` if you are building for Cuttlefish.

1. Install the AVF APEX to the device.
   ```sh
   adb install out/dist/com.android.virt.apex
   adb reboot; adb wait-for-device
   ```

## Step 4: Run a Microdroid VM

[Microdroid](../../microdroid/README.md) is a lightweight version of Android
that is intended to run on pVM. You can run a Microdroid-based VM with an empty
payload using the following command:

```shell
package/modules/Virtualization/vm/vm_shell.sh start-microdroid --auto-connect -- --protected
```

You will see the log messages like the below.

```

```

The `--auto-connect` option provides you an adb-shell connection to the VM. The
shell promot (`#`) at the end of the log is for that.

## Step 5: Run tests

There are various tests that spawn guest VMs and check different aspects of the
architecture. They all can run via `atest`.

```shell
atest MicrodroidHostTestCases
atest MicrodroidTestApp
```

If you run into problems, inspect the logs produced by `atest`. Their location
is printed at the end. The `host_log_*.zip` file should contain the output of
individual commands as well as VM logs.
